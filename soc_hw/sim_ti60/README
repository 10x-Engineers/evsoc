#Introduction
-----------------------
This is testbench template for Efinix SOC. Modelsim run script is provided. Modify run.sh or run.bat to change other simulator run script.

#Installation
-----------------------
1.  Open run.bat or run.sh
2.  Check for PATH variable, add directory path of your simulator to this PATH variable.

#How to use
-----------------------
1.  Copy software user app binary file to "sim_ti60" folder. By default, evsoc_ispExample_sim.bin app is provided.
2.  Generate required Efinix IP(s) using Efinity IP Manager prior simulation.
3a. For Windows user, double click run.bat to start run the simulation.
3b. For Linux user, execute './run.sh' to start run the simulation.

#How to target user app
-----------------------
1.  Open run.bat or run.sh
2.  Check for MyApp variable, modify it to your app's name.

#Note
-----------------------
1.  Ruby SOC simulation bypass SPI flash offloading process, thus do not use *.bin in "sim_ti60" folder in real hardware implementation.
2.  Simulation models of MIPI CSI-2 Rx controller and MIPI DSI Tx controller are placed in ./model folder. IPM generated version of stated
    IPs is not compatible for Modelsim simulation until planned update is available in Efinity 2021.2.
