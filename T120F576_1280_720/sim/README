#How to use
-----------------------
1. Prior simulation, generate required Efinix IP(s) in Efinity project folder using Efinity IP Manager.
2. To run SoC simulation using default application, execute "Python3 run.py". 
   The provided default application is evsoc_ispExample_sim.
3. To simulation with a different application, use command "Python3 run.py -b <path to application>/app.bin".
   Note that, application binary .bin file is generated by Eclipse project build.

#Note
-----------------------
1. SoC simulation bypass SPI flash offloading process, thus do not use the SoC *.bin in "sim" folder for real hardware implementation.
